# XamarinBluetooth
Control a Bluetooth-device from your Xamarin-Android app

This Xamarin-App allows you to:

You can use this app to control a Bluetooth Car for example.

In my case, this project does not throw any Exceptions like:
- Java.IO.IOException: "read failed, socket might closed or timeout, read ret: -1"

If it does, please let me know.
